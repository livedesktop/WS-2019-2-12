There are numerous examples about people ruining nature in order to get to certain treasure of to get to free resources, without taking care if those resources are renewable or they will leave terrible traces on the earth. Sometimes the nature pays back in order to keep its balance but sometimes people go that far that nothing could be done in order to preserve its beauty and significance.\r\n\r\nDiona is a mermaid who is in charge of keeping the underwater treasures safe. That counts for the mysterious locations that should be kept away from people sight, so no man could find them, but also for the sea legends that shouldn't be revealed too. Even if that might sound little bit wicked, she actually gives people wrong traces, directing them to look for some wrong locations because she doesn't like her world to be revealed and eventually destroyed by the people.\r\n\r\nBetween those legends that have been successfully kept by Diona is the one about the submerged civilization of Atlantis. Diona has managed to hide that part of the sea where this land was submerged rather successfully. She likes this story to stay just a legend and no one to find out the secret about it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P424FRTSRSN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"MotoGP Racing Championship","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43749.14597546430387095.ebcfb051-d1ba-4ae3-85de-5b7a476c93bf.cdf26d15-2f6e-4d64-af51-70910e284be8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25273.14597546430387095.ebcfb051-d1ba-4ae3-85de-5b7a476c93bf.f5d711a7-7193-47f0-98dc-2a7185fe4e3f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$2.95","Price":2.95,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["56106MarcinBoh.MotoGPRacingChampionship_rwaxw234y3f2c"],"ContentIds":["e9379b56-7354-c23c-89aa-4dc5488779a0","20838e74-52eb-556c-1a92-7c0fb58248e5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you have a competitor's heart?

That’s why we have developed Multiplication Dragons, to provide new, fun ways to engage with multiplication that stimulate ease of memorization and improved recall. We all know how difficult it is to remember things without using the proper tools, and Multiplication Dragons provides just that. Our brightly colored, unique, three-dimensional environments provide visual and auditory spaces in which children can learn by associating multiplication questions with a rhyme, an in-game location, and the dragon that asks the question.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons helps increase memorization and ease of recall using two memory devices that reinforce each other: rhyme and the memory palace (a.k.a. the method of loci). It will introduce your child to the world of multiplication using 3D animated dragons that guide them through 12 different environments, including a lagoon, a Halloween inspired level, a mountain, caves, a winter setting, and more! Each of the 144 questions is asked by one of our many dragons, stationed in various locations and levels throughout the game. Questions are asked using a phrase that both rhymes with the answer, and relates to the particular surroundings of the level currently being played. Multiplication questions also appear onscreen and are read aloud, a design feature used to help young readers and those experiencing difficulty reading, and to provide our dragons with a bit of extra personality. \r\n\r\nWe draw on rhyme because it has been used in various ways and has stood the test of time as a mnemonic device. After all, how many times has the age-old “thirty days has September, April, June, and November” rhyme helped you to recall the number of days in a month? It has been used for generations, and proven its success over and over again. Our second memory device, the memory palace, is one of the oldest and most successful tools in the book! This method goes back to the ancient Greeks, and involves imagining a familiar environment (like your home) and associating the things to be remembered with particular areas or aspects of that environment.  The visual and spatial qualities of this form provide additional contact points that aid in the creation of cognitive associations with the thing that we want to remember. This creates more access routes for our brains to get at the desired information, and thus increases ease of recall. By using both of these methods together we have increased these possible cognitive associations even further, while providing you and your child with hours of fun!\r\n\r\nChildren will earn 1-3 stars based on the amount of correct answers given on a level, giving them the opportunity to return to a level and break their current score. They will also get an encouraging cheer from our dragons for each right or wrong answer, and unlock new levels by successfully completing a timetable level. They can also make use of an added visual cue by reviewing the timetable itself, and test recall by attempting quiz mode. Here, your child must answer questions without the rhymes, and in random order, simulating a school math test. And unlike other games that offer one free level and then charge you for the remaining eleven, we ask for one payment which includes access to all twelve levels, quiz mode, and timetable mode.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons provides your child with a whole world of exploration that introduces, reinforces, and tests multiplication skills, in a mode that feels like play. It’s time exchange the mechanical repetition of rote learning for techniques that make memorization easy and fun. Add some good-times to your tables, with Multiplication Dragons!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MZ55V57K252","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kick the Buddy Jumper","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13749.13877110621735951.879dc551-4b33-427c-8e14-3f5f48acec33.7cd78a51-9ded-4ef1-adc9-cf095707a50f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41088.13877110621735951.879dc551-4b33-427c-8e14-3f5f48acec33.dc9c32c9-521a-4b41-8950-2e1dc37b074f","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58707.13877110621735951.879dc551-4b33-427c-8e14-3f5f48acec33.b81b97b5-53bb-46dc-add5-8efdcf24c35c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5352.13877110621735951.879dc551-4b33-427c-8e14-3f5f48acec33.30b2045a-8755-400a-9dab-5eb5638a461f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.526.13877110621735951.879dc551-4b33-427c-8e14-3f5f48acec33.681b92d5-bfff-47c2-862b-90d335bfc8ee","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14801.13877110621735951.879dc551-4b33-427c-8e14-3f5f48acec33.18c19dad-573e-4b1c-a169-9700be430266","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["8533SmartGamesProMX.KicktheBuddyJumper_5m91jtwxk93h0"],"ContentIds":["137a8f7d-6a33-d76f-4905-5e160057492d","a6167196-d616-1448-e3ff-f0852ecbfe03"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Somewhere in the kitchen of a high-rise block, there were vegetables living together harmoniously in a wooden box under the sink. \r\n\r\nKick the Buddy Jumper can run very fast, but the racing track is full of troubles especially lot of dangers ready to take the Carrot Defense Kick the Buddy Jumper down.

It's inspired by Fortnite and PUBG. You must try and survive as the last standing combatant against the hundreds of other players online. Use the WASD keys to move around the map and use the left click mouse button to shoot. You must interact with various objects in the world to pick up supplies to survive. \r\nLook for weapons and food and try to eliminate as many other players as possible. You also have to watch out for the poisonous gas that steadily closes in on the map and makes the playable area smaller - if you get caught in the gas you will eventually die. Consider your strategy and try to survive at all costs. This game requires skill, quick reactions and perseverance! Become the Zombs Royale champion today!\r\n\r\nThe gameplay that you can find in ZombsRoyale.io is similar to Surviv.io and our other Battle Royale games. Make sure to give them a try as well!\r\n\r\nThis player will allow you to open your favorite web games inside a self-contained UWP app.  This allows better performance, privacy, and security.

The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score. You score with every successful shot and you are fined with every missed torpedo.  \r\n\r\nPlease, check our website for tips and tricks on the game here: http://pepper-games.com","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLFW1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Drag Racing 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31372.9007199266414728.19fe3d7c-eaac-47ec-96c7-795f82c530d5.71aa4a3a-87c0-4114-9d17-174a54564105","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$1.45","Price":1.45,"AverageRating":4.8,"RatingsCount":"12","PackageFamilyNames":["46565REVOLUTIONFIST.DragRacing3D_zx5e914mrp7t8"],"ContentIds":["6927314d-c9a2-00e8-0af4-f34f93c65794","87034990-8221-c7c9-71f5-df34626e97ea"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"EXCITING RACING!\r\nIt is the game, where you can race through dark streets. \r\nDrag Racing 3D © is exciting night street races.

How do they know an opponent has a singleton king? It seems like they can see the opponents' cards, or read their minds! Nothing could be further from the truth!\r\nBy logically analyzing all of the available information from the bidding and playing of the cards, the correct way to play a hand presents itself. The hands in this app do not contain complicated distributions or complex squeeze situations. On the contrary.\r\nWith help from questions Marty asks, thinking logically and reasoning correctly will become second nature. You will reap the rewards at the bridge table and have your opponents asking how you knew the queen was a singleton or that the suit split 4-0.\r\nThis app contains 57 hands where you are declarer and 52 hands where you are defending. All of the hands have expert comments from Marty Bergen. \r\n\r\nWhen playing the deals, you will feel as if Marty Bergen is looking over your shoulder and giving you advice and tips to help you find the best way to play the hand.\r\n\r\nThis app is perfect for the bridge player who wants to improve his/her playing skills. When you are playing the deal but don’t play perfectly, you will get a message explanation what you should have done. You also have the option to let the program ask you questions about the play. Every bridge player should ask these questions themselves before playing a card. By answering the questions  you will learn the best approach. Once you are used to asking yourself these type of questions, you will have made a big step in improving your play and becoming a better opponent.\r\nThe bidding system is based on Standard American. However, the auction is always provided for you so this program is appropriate for all players.\r\n\r\nTo use the app, no internet connection is needed.\r\n\r\nAbout Marty Bergen\r\nMarty is a U.S. bridge teacher/player/author.  He is a ten-time national champion and ACBL Grand Life Master and World Bridge Federation World International Master. He retired from active competition in 1993 to concentrate on teaching and writing. He was recently voted to be the 22 most influential person in the history of bridge. \r\nMarty has been a columnist in the monthly ACBL Bridge Bulletin since 1976. He has also written 69 bridge books; two of which won the ABTA Bridge Book of the Year award.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52!

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ2W2","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"3rd Floor Spider Solitaire","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.3639.9007199266245891.df94b5d1-1862-420c-9094-300f73187fd5.51bcd7c1-95dd-41b3-9f58-122a0e75523e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#009F2E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.1529.9007199266245891.322c19b7-3b14-46f8-b2f1-7a4f9b70a514.b7f604a7-4aa8-4bd1-835d-d6175e7a2bc1","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#009F2E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.23782.9007199266245891.3cc9940a-6645-408b-89c6-b05d4fd2eb5b.beead1a1-001e-4602-9c39-f558e1ca85e5","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#009F2E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.55021.9007199266245891.272ce2f8-d45a-4851-98d3-5fedba684ea1.dea2cbe6-a158-44b7-8825-3c57e6ab494c","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#009F2E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.63023.9007199266245891.78478fdf-f704-48eb-949b-125208735649.e5a5851f-0fa4-4aac-bb37-51bf266fadeb","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#009F2E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.61400.9007199266245891.b784b97e-d147-4dfd-a526-0a92098e825d.2a8b088e-0670-4c2a-83fd-0a686afe25d9","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#009F2E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"128","PackageFamilyNames":["3rdFloorGames.3rdFloorSpiderSolitaire_6s8xxjhexmxkj"],"ContentIds":["146df817-4917-3a48-d227-7386a7f8896d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play the BEST Spider Solitaire game for Windows!\r\n\r\nEnjoy the traditional gameplay of Spider Solitaire, completely free for Windows.

She has passed a long way just to get to the crystal tree. If you are wondering why exactly that tree, hear this reason. Namely, Lori's sister is very sick for a longer period of time. She has tried numerous medications that were promising a relief from her sickness, but none of these gave a positive result. That's why Lori decided to go as far as she needs just to get to the crystal tree. Actually Lori believes that someone has made an evil magic to her sister. She has heard that the most helpful objects can be found around that crystal tree and only those objects could save her sister. This tree seems like the only hope for the sister so Lori will do everything needed for her sister to feel better.\r\n\r\nLet's help the two sisters bring their lives to normal by helping Lori collect all the magical objects. Those objects are rather promising. They might be the only solution that will cure her sister and expel the evil magic so let's don't waste our time but help them get what they
