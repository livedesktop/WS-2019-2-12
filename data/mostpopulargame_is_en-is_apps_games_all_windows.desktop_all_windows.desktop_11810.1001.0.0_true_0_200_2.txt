Optimized for mobile users, this extreme fighter game is ripe with challenges. Walk around this 3D pixel world and confront deadly enemies all while collection an assortment of sophisticated, modern day weapons, ammo and health. Bring down your wrath in an amazing mission with varied enemies. Become the last line of defense in a sci-fi world of epic proportions. Enemies are everywhere and you must defeat every last one in order to claim the title as ultimate victor. \r\n\r\n??Time is running out...??\r\n\r\nI am a prisoner on a planet in a galaxy devoid of human life. I know little about my origins, only that the planet had seen a total annihilation of human life centuries ago at the hands of the robots who dominated it and I was the last human on earth. I exist in a cell so tiny that I cannot lay flat, but rather have to sleep in the fetal position. My cell is always cold and drips waste from the city above. I have seen light very few times in my existence, but when I have, I was chained in manacles and paraded about the city to the delight of the robots and their fat, alien comrades. I harbored no hope of leaving this place. That was, until six months ago when I heard it whispered between wardens that a planet was discovered where humans not only exist, they thrive. The word war was being bandied about, but I cared naught of their tactics, for the first bloom of hope had sprung to life in my chest. For the first time since I was a wee boy and my spunk was beaten mercilessly from me, I was determined to be more than a prisoner. Despite the size of my cage, I refused to let my surroundings hinder my plans of escape. I worked out tirelessly, working my weary bones until I could start to feel the strength building in my body. I would escape, but to fully succeed and reunite with those of my own ilk, I would need to confront these foes and escape this hell hole altogether. This is my tale, the story of how I escaped this planet and vanquished my enemies.\r\n\r\n??Ready your weapons...??\r\n\r\nThis mission features a great variety of enemies, but when you start the game, you will be unarmed. In order to do battle, you must locate and equip a weapon. A selection of melee and firearm weapons exist across the maps. Your entity map will be a valuable asset as it allows you an aerial view of oncoming enemies so you can be prepared to strike. Collect health and ammo perks while you can, for these pickups will decrease as the levels progress making your mission all the more challenging. Let your surroundings aid your quest. Exploding barrels can be found and utilized to strategically take down enemies. Enjoy non-stop FPS action with endless battles and treacherous terrain. \r\n\r\nHow to play: Use the simple touch screen control pad to easily move, fight, select weapons and more. Kill enemies, utilize exploding barrels. Keep an eye out for hidden perks and weapons. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n-Addictive and mesmerizing maps\r\n-Efficient weapon controls and movement\r\n-Fight your way against dozens of foes\r\n-Think strategically\r\n-Interactive surroundings\r\n-Heated gun battles and ruthless snipers\r\n-Pixel style defense game\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NT7F14NQL15","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Blackjack 21 Vegas Casino","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62953.14423470528301660.220103c0-e150-4e2d-ba56-828d6cd0761c.73c9b6f3-e4b9-4fba-8e56-4f1a0412ecc9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18993.14423470528301660.526a7508-633a-4e3d-a781-17fdce80eeb1.35538829-647b-4519-85f4-a7b8926d0743","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62953.14423470528301660.220103c0-e150-4e2d-ba56-828d6cd0761c.73c9b6f3-e4b9-4fba-8e56-4f1a0412ecc9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12262FiveStarGames.Blackjack21VegasCasino_s5tp8gve928er"],"ContentIds":["025c1f32-fc04-54ec-8340-dc02c4b51ab3","d8c5f02c-574a-db5f-b4c6-889bbf8c4e3b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Blackjack 21 is a casino poker game.

Backgammon is a board game in which you move the pieces around the board according to dice rolls. Once you get all the pieces in the house you take them out according to your dice. The first player to get all the pieces out wins the game.\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ challenging AI\r\n\r\n✓ auto bear off\r\n\r\n✓ easy to select and move pieces\r\n\r\n✓ fluid animations \r\n\r\n✓ HD graphics\r\n\r\n✓ detailed statistics\r\n\r\n✓ nice music and sound effects\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Your pieces are white and your opponent's pieces are black. There are 24 places on the board and two places to deposit the pieces. The 24 places are represented as triangles and called points. So the 1-point is the first place where pieces can stay. \r\n\r\n✓ The points from 1 to 6 are called the opponents’ home and the points from 19 to 24 are your home on the board. The opponent needs to bring all his pieces in the home region in order to take them out and so do you.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move around the board in one direction. You move from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner then to the top-left corner and finally to the top-right corner on a path that resembles a horseshoe. The points from 1 to 24 follow this path in the same direction. Your opponent moves in the opposite direction following this path. \r\n\r\n✓ The game starts with a couple of dice rolls that decide which player should begin first. The opponent rolls first, then you. The one with the biggest pips’ count on the dice starts first. A pip is a dot on the face of a dice which counts as a point of movement or placement.\r\n\r\n✓ When your turn comes you start by rolling the dice and continue by making the moves.\r\n\r\n✓ If you roll a double your pips count will be twice the pips�� sum of the dice.\r\n\r\n✓ After you roll the dice some top pieces on your triangles, will be highlighted. You can start your move with any of those highlighted pieces. To move the pieces, you select the piece by tapping on the triangle on which it lies. Then, at that point the triangle turns blue and the places to which you can move next turn green. Tap on any of those green triangles to initiate the move. When the move ends and if there are moves left on the dice new pieces will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n✓ If one of your dice is one you can move one of your pieces only one position. If the piece lies on 2-point you can move it on 3-point for example. If you roll a double, you can make four moves with the same value of the dice from that roll.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move your pieces to columns occupied by your pieces, to empty places or places in which your opponent has one piece. \r\n\r\n✓ If you move your piece over the opponent's single piece you can capture it.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The floor is lava challenge is also known as hot lava or the ground is lava.\r\n\r\nHow to Play: \r\nYou must avoid touching the ground lest you get burned when the screen shows ‘the floor is lava!’ in our game. You are required to run because you can’t remain still. How long can you survive?\r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\n- Simple tap/swipe controls and easy to play\r\n- Visually pleasing to play the game in various grounds\r\n- Endless rewards for your skills!\r\n\r\nDownload \"The Floor Is Lava - A Floor Escape & Runner Game\"","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PKTF39FGJHC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bike Stunt Race X3M","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41491.14255744435725546.f66e76d7-c6bf-4aae-ac61-1fa936efd15f.4cf19184-bb8e-46ec-a467-0f16fc9041e7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16443.14255744435725546.f66e76d7-c6bf-4aae-ac61-1fa936efd15f.642c290b-2509-41b3-ba77-ef3895ccafc4","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["54917CheetahPvPGames.BikeStuntRaceX3M_1211aek6hfxsa"],"ContentIds":["633640c5-7c67-51c8-f08e-2b37756857c3","1dc6d991-dc13-7ed1-7756-413e7311fb8f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Bike Stunt Race X3M is one of the best racing game on Windows! - The newest extreme motorbike racing game is here!\r\n\r\n★★ Amazing Motorcycle Racing Game! ★★\r\n\r\nFury road is calling you, motorcycle racer.

It includes 16 thoughtfully designed fun games, containing very colorful and attractive images/sounds. Kids enjoy playing these games for hours without getting bored, and at the same time learning skills, which are carefully incorporated in the design of each game. \r\n\r\nWhat makes this app special is that so many different types of games are present in a single place, which are normally found in separate different apps.\r\n\r\nGames are designed to enhance following skills:\r\n  1. Basic mathematics\r\n  2. Numbers recognition\r\n  3. Hand-eye coordination\r\n  4. Concentration\r\n  5. Visual perception\r\n  6. Vocabulary\r\n  7. Classification\r\n  8. Symmetry\r\n  9. Organizing\r\n 10. Memory\r\n 11. Matching\r\n 12. Attention to detail\r\n\r\nFollowing is the list of games sections:\r\n\r\n-Match the shadow\r\n-Count 123\r\n-Scratch to reveal\r\n-Cow Mania\r\n-Hungry Lizzy\r\n-Tricky maze\r\n-Jigsaw puzzle\r\n-Odd one out\r\n-Bingo fun\r\n-Missing objects\r\n-Fill the colors\r\n-Find odd items\r\n-Spot the difference\r\n-Match the numbers\r\n-Sort it out\r\n-Learn to trace\r\n\r\nIn addition to each individual game section, there is a common 'playground' where kid will be presented with a mix of games from all sections. If kid is interested more in some types of games, he/she can skip the ones he/she doesn't want.\r\n\r\nTo keep kids challenged, points are awarded for each game stage completed. A scoreboard is maintained which kid can see after each game. When kid scores enough points, he/she earns a sticker of his/her choice. All his/her earned stickers are kept in a box which he/she can relish any time they want later.\r\n\r\nWe have put our every effort to make this app interesting and beautiful. But we would love to hear your views/feedback/ratings on the same.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Score strikes, spares, and turkeys.\r\n\r\nPICK UP SPARES\r\n\r\nPractice challenging spares. Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKX22","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Random Text Adventure","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.44795.9007199266532129.413e8218-40a7-49ce-916a-af7c0617d1b0.02f0b19e-cf50-44ae-a8c0-f701b711d821","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.19399.9007199266532129.da140eb6-831d-4a0b-a731-df1500d04c3b.8782f864-0cc8-40d1-9bbd-583a666a0893","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["52077thriggle.RandomTextAdventure_wwta8xdjb2dfc"],"ContentIds":["cdb04614-08a8-a94a-94f1-71fff20d18cb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Explore a randomly generated world inhabited by strange creatures, presented in the style of classic text-based adventure games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM8T0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sudoku+","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15972.9007199266445553.44bc064a-a07e-4282-8858-4aa3d991335a.31fa1990-6745-4700-af92-7cfb3fd611c6","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63850.9007199266445553.7582f6ba-de09-41fb-8701-d347e2f44796.cf46def0-be8f-4fbf-b166-f0b02eec62c7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41699.9007199266445553.2a2775f5-1e6c-4f65-ac56-fd1e1c565369.35fb2baa-c342-469e-ad0a-52a2e525ee5f","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62272.9007199266445553.7517ff71-f77f-44d8-bc2c-d940d270f659.1157cfe2-7e02-42f6-aee0-0468a9a783b3","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42064.9007199266445553.7af1fb5f-348b-4c28-ba63-c8b996576ab7.dba714fb-f781-4f1e-bdcd-697ac7248833","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15775.9007199266445553.fca28684-c091-4741-b610-9477d3229476.9c9e7974-e117-4e39-a16b-0cb52a3425bd","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52930.9007199266445553.ccbea651-beef-4383-9bac-2bf32f83f5c2.a4360dd8-f11e-4d9b-a120-ee19ef144ea2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["56963Oxozle.HD_g8mgcn8w2fxt6"],"ContentIds":["a95baa30-e4f8-3ede-1219-f2800fed5ca7","a720f09e-1d03-2c77-e49f-719387427ef3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Popular puzzle with numbers.

CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don’t forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there’s something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice! Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia 2520.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\r\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\r\n\r\nDon't forget to follow us on social media:\r\nFacebook: http://gmlft.co/SNS_FB_EN\r\nTwitter: http://gmlft.co/SNS_TW_EN\r\nInstagram: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_IG\r\nYouTube: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_YT\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to purchase virtual items within the app and may contain third party advertisements that may redirect you to a third party site.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice\r\nTerms of Use: http://www.gameloft.com/en/conditions-of-use\r\nEnd-User License Agreement: http://www.gameloft.com/en/eula","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1Z7TW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Horizon 3","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56315.13510798886196618.c69955b8-0c9f-4ed7-a431-3d447a97bc78.d261c045-1905-4431-8be9-08248a0fdfd4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64761.13510798886196618.50f5e180-67d1-476d-a4ef-174d6b220526.305ec856-672f-4db7-af88-3e5bade8c67d","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35178.13510798886196618.8fb909fd-bb9c-4611-aa4e-03bade5ac8f0.492dbe98-0433-4b96-a60f-7d2ba7c3d753","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4458.13510798886196618.298e2154-4100-40ae-bd88-68cc23b9269c.a9034108-464e-4db2-9132-fb7f7839eebe","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15767.13510798886196618.7b563777-0837-4cb2-97f3-546ddb595198.3852efb4-2956-433f-a763-44732ac8338b","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58425.13510798886196618.b6116342-bb1b-4855-8304-88c1cb3e6050.cd8962ae-980f-4868-a494-49fd3f2bf104","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"","DisplayPrice":"","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"54","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.OpusPG_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["a7f01538-3078-1241-16ad-b380ee274507","28f380ea-f8c6-287a-1753-83eccb5e296b","e24186ce-9f25-4898-8b70-013b4a4f3f21"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Xbox One X Enhanced with native 4K support.

Whilst AI has suddenly become fashionable the 2019 edition celebrates 16 years of ZingMagic bringing you the best in artificial intelligence based board, card and puzzle games, and over 35 years of Bridge products, starting with the Bridge Challenger. \r\n\r\nOmar Sharif Bridge supports 2 variants of the card game of Bridge: Rubber and Chicago (Four-deal) Bridge.\r\n\r\nBridge is played by four players who form two partnerships. Players within a partnership face each other across a table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles.

Also known as Patience Klondike.\r\n\r\nTaking a shuffled standard 52-card deck of playing cards (without Jokers), one upturned card is dealt on the left of the playing area, then six downturned cards (from left to right). On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The point of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit- the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player will have won.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDSNQF","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Classic Spider Solitaire","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.3687.9007199266591670.3fae3d53-c62e-4e9e-804c-986da6c9172a.1e5f9010-c43f-4728-9827-d84c8fe5b200","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#3F6016","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64446.9007199266591670.17848136-dc32-4602-836c-fc1b03497ed3.b19c3596-61d2-48e4-b584-12bdd25e61c3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3F6016","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["19789RossBor.ClassicSpiderSolitaire_bckpywbq9b7yj"],"ContentIds":["07ca1c8e-7fbd-f00c-f8b3-e989630ddb63"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Classic Spider Solitaire is a popular solitaire card game.

Each player has nine pieces, or \"men\", which move among the board's twenty-four spots. The object of the game is to leave the opposing player with fewer than three pieces or no legal moves.\r\nThe game begins with an empty board. Players take turns placing their pieces on empty spots. If a player is able to form a straight row of three pieces along one of the board's lines (i.e. not diagonally), he has a \"mill\" and may remove one of his opponent's pieces from the board; removed pieces may not be placed again. Players must remove any other pieces first before removing a piece from a formed mill. Once all eighteen pieces have been used, players take turns moving.\r\nTo move, a player slides one of his pieces along a board line to an empty adjacent spot. If he cannot do so, he has lost the game.\r\nAs in the placement stage, a player who aligns three of his pieces on a board line has a mill and may remove one of his opponent's pieces, avoiding the removal of pieces in mills if at all possible. Any player reduced to two pieces is unable to remove any more opposing pieces and thus loses the game.\r\nOnce a player is reduced to three pieces, his pieces may \"fly\" to any empty spots, not only adjacent ones.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PBH5SFB2XNJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"VIP Slots Club","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5325.14119079045965359.836109f3-780f-4037-9b85-7e2ab1e3ec1e.975b28fb-ad68-4333-8479-78bd267bca74","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10582.14119079045965359.836109f3-780f-4037-9b85-7e2ab1e3ec1e.28a83a3a-45eb-4d65-b48f-2fa09b4d5137","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1620.14119079045965359.836109f3-780f-4037-9b85-7e2ab1e3ec1e.b101b819-5708-45a1-b18f-349fcc2f631a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28901.14119079045965359.77b757e0-7e96-4873-a9c1-0cf6685ba1b9.c596596f-2eb5-48a8-b6c3-6a5c58325f54","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19084.14119079045965359.77b757e0-7e96-4873-a9c1-0cf6685ba1b9.567b3003-aef7-4ccd-8f58-dfaa7eb694d0","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57633.14119079045965359.fe965a25-8af1-4b13-9eab-7de7af1a36e4.0c7fd945-025e-4f15-9436-05c64796334c","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["54823Duksel.VIPSlotsClub_3qy5jhydqcr2j"],"ContentIds":["e0876501-7975-fe6a-0fda-d58a7a3914c5","80815a87-2a65-d323-3631-91e63c5bb8ca"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"VIP Slots Casino Game = Huge Payouts = Mega Bonus Games\r\n\r\nWelcome to popular Las Vegas VIP Casino Slot Machines .
