It is a two player game where playing pieces are moved according to the roll of dice, and a player wins by removing all of their pieces from the board before their opponent. Backgammon is a member of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games.\r\nBackgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over series of many games, somewhat like poker. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. The optional use of a doubling cube allows players to raise the stakes during the game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PJVQ6KLVPD5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dragon City GO!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2996.14279243853433750.bc077668-b52e-47c2-a263-e178f9ef1510.66ab0606-93ea-48a8-ad4f-44933f18deb6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21688.14279243853433750.98e264f9-35fc-4bf5-a8da-11bad851c2ea.97a52ee7-1531-4988-9d58-e0ea7e9a1de6","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2996.14279243853433750.bc077668-b52e-47c2-a263-e178f9ef1510.66ab0606-93ea-48a8-ad4f-44933f18deb6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["57689BIGWINStudio.DragonCityGO_ksj94409qacn2"],"ContentIds":["760c44dd-e1ef-8c7b-ed63-eac4f4346661","843b392d-e950-455e-f5db-82f20837c07a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Super Poke monsters are waiting for you!

\r\nMeet one of the most entertaining birds on the planet.  Our flappy friend migrated to another amusement island further in the south, where you can find the coolest mini golf tracks placed on an exotic beach.  Many trucks are littered with old clay pots that could obstruct your way.  Smash them to free your way to the hole. As the bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented some parts of  the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations\r\n- 4 amazing courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive par\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible fruit like, bananas and water melon to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. If you can make it with no more than 3 par (hits) you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible bananas and Water melon slices that can increase your final score.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one water melon piece you will get back one par (hit) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nJoin this crazy bird on his holiday at the beach and have some real fun playing this epic game.\r\n\r\nChallenge your friends and show them who the king of the trucks

The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode.

Board pieces move based on dice throws.\r\n\r\nThis is a game of skill. A single game can be decided by luck, but the more one plays, the more the skill is important. After ~30 games the true skill emerges. Even a beginner can beat an expert through luck of draw in a single game, but after several games the skill prevails.\r\n\r\nThis version of Backgammon uses an advanced neural network in the highest levels, and will challenge advanced players. It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or reducing rating points every game or match.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n=========\r\n* Worldwide online high scores\r\n* Play a Trial Game, or a Scored Game that counts towards your score\r\n* High res graphic board\r\n* Dice statistics history\r\n* Real time probability calculation\r\n* Achievements\r\n* Tutorials\r\n* 4 difficulty levels: easy to hard\r\n* 1 or 2 player mode\r\n* Many options:\r\n    -

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber.
